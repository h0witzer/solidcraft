//! The flat shape of a cut through a panel of a sheet made from surfaces whose walls are not
//! square to it (#6748): the region of the panel's parameters whose fibers, square through the
//! sheet's thickness, meet the material the cut took, read from the faces the cut left (its
//! walls), exactly. Its outline is made of:
//!
//! - a wall's edge on the panel's face, where the wall narrows the hole going into the material
//!   (a wall edge-on to the fibers counts as narrowing: its two edges lie on one line of the flat);
//! - a wall's edge on the face one thickness in, where the wall widens it;
//! - a wall's fold, where it turns edge-on to the fibers, followed on its own surface;
//! - the edge between two walls, where one narrows the hole and the other widens it.
//!
//! These meet end to end at corners found exactly on the edges, where a wall's leaning changes
//! along them, so the outline is put together from how its pieces meet, never by joining
//! overlapping shapes: a fold meets an edge tangent to it in the flat, where a union of the two
//! could not tell them apart. An edge piece on flat material is the line or the arc it is,
//! exactly; elsewhere a curve is put through its points.
//!
//! A cut whose walls cross a joint is read the same way in the sheet as a whole ([`Folded`]):
//! each point in whichever piece of the flat holds its fiber (a panel, a tab, or a bend's zone,
//! unwrapped round its axis), its outline drawn in the flat, one curve across tangent lines and
//! seams. Refused: walls that don't run through the thickness from face to face (a countersink, a
//! rounded or chamfered face edge, a recess, a cut that stops inside a bend), walls that reach the
//! sheet's outline, and walls whose shapes in the flat overlap.
