//! What a perforation field's holes take out of a sheet made from surfaces (#6748, #732). The
//! holes are not cut into the body: the sheet's physical properties take them off its measure.
//! A hole lies where its field's grid puts it on the developed flat, clear of the bends the sheet
//! had when the field was made (see [`SurfaceSheet::perforation_holes`]). On a flat panel it is a
//! cylinder through the thickness. A bend made after the field runs through it, as a press brake
//! bends perforated stock, and the hole bends with it: its part in the bend is the bend's own map
//! of that part of the flat, and the rest lies on the two panels.
//!
//! Each part is integrated in the bend's coordinates: along the joint, across the zone and through
//! the thickness. A bend's map is linear along the joint, and its volume grows linearly through
//! the thickness, so a three-point Gauss rule is exact in both. Across the zone the hole's chord
//! is r cos θ where w = c + r sin θ, which leaves an analytic integrand; composite Gauss–Legendre
//! takes it to round-off. Nothing is tessellated.
//!
//! A hexagonal or slotted hole on a flat panel, and every hole of a sheet laid out flat, is the
//! prism of its outline through the thickness, its area, centroid and second moments in closed
//! form. One that a bend runs through is split, as a round one is, into its parts on the two
//! panels and in the bend, each its own map of its part of the flat. Each part's integrals over
//! the flat become integrals round its outline by Green's theorem: the outline's lines and arcs
//! are cut where they cross the zone's edges, and the zone's edges themselves add nothing, since
//! they run along the joint.
