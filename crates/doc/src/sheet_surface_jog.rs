//! Jog on a sheet made from surfaces (#6046, #6748): an offset step across a flat panel, made as
//! two folds. The first bends the panel along the jog line; the second bends the panel the first
//! made back the other way, a straight wall further on, so the far side ends up parallel to where
//! it was and `offset` from it. Both bends take their zones from the panels' own material, so the
//! flat keeps its size.
